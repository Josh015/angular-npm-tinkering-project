# Angular NPM tinkering project

This test project is a heavily-modified version of the code from the [pluralsight course Angular Material](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-material) to provide me with a suitably complex codebase for trying out various Angular packages and seeing how they interact.

## To Run

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Included Packages

I've utilized a cross-section of NPM packages that I consider to be indispensible in a modern web application.

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [ESLInt](https://eslint.org/)
- [messageformat](https://messageformat.github.io/messageformat/)
- [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)
- [ngx-translate](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
