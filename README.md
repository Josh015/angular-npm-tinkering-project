# Angular NPM tinkering project

This test project is a heavily-modified version of the code from the [pluralsight course Angular Material](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-material) to provide me with a suitably complex codebase for trying out various Angular packages and seeing how they interact.

## To Run

```shell
ng serve -o
```
